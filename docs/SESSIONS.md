**2026-09-12 — Phase 2 database schema session**

Built: `supabase/migrations/20260912000000_phase2_schema.sql` (new file, new `supabase/` top-level directory). Implements the full data model from ARCHITECTURE.md Section 6: `users` (kept in sync with `auth.users` via trigger, `display_name` client-editable, `email`/`id` locked to service-role writes only), `daily_game_definitions` + `daily_game_definition_slots` (split into two tables — 12 rows/day for the definitions, 26 child rows each for the per-slot theme/board shuffle — rather than one wide table, since the original indicative column list conflated the two granularities), `player_daily_order` (with a trigger validating the stored array is a true 0–11 permutation), `attempts` (summary-only; raw `{seed, moves[]}` payloads are never persisted, matching the infra cost-planning decision that only summary rows are permanent), `daily_stats`/`weekly_stats`/`all_time_stats`, and `user_year_activity`. Row Level Security enabled on every table: players can read their own rows plus public leaderboard aggregates and a name-only `leaderboard_profiles` view; no table is client-writable except `users.display_name` — attempt start/completion, stats aggregation, and game-definition generation are all reserved for service-role Edge Functions in later phases.

Bugs fixed: none (new schema, not yet run against the live project).

Decisions made: see DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-12 (Phase 2) block — the definitions/slots table split, and the attempts_started vs. attempts_completed averaging interpretation for the leaderboard cascade's four "average" tiers.

**Next session start point:** the migration file has been delivered but not yet run. First, confirm it was pasted into the Supabase SQL Editor and executed successfully (check for errors, especially around the `auth.users` triggers, which need appropriate permissions). Once confirmed, check off Phase 2 in ROADMAP.md and proceed to Phase 3 — Auth (email OTP signup/login flow, profile screen for name/email changes).

**2026-09-12 — Phase 1 infra session**

Built: no code — this session was entirely manual account/infra setup, walked through step by step. Package name decided (`com.gc.matchemojisdaily`). Firebase project created, Android app registered, `google-services.json` obtained and stored as a GitHub secret, Analytics confirmed active, Crashlytics enablement deferred to Phase 4. AdMob account created, app registered, all 3 ad units created (Rewarded/Interstitial/Banner) with real IDs, linked to Firebase. Supabase project created (Mumbai region), email OTP auth confirmed enabled and hardened (6-digit codes, shorter expiry, secure email change on), personal access token generated and scoped narrowly (Edge Functions: Read-write only). Android release keystore generated (30-year validity). GitHub Pages enabled. All 6 required GitHub Actions secrets added and confirmed via screenshot: `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`, `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`.

Bugs/incidents: a Supabase access token was pasted into chat despite guidance not to; treated as compromised, revoked, and rotated before being added as a secret directly. See DECISIONS.md for the standing practice this established. Separately corrected a wrong assumption from ROADMAP.md's original Phase 1 write-up: Android keystores in PKCS12 format (the modern default) don't support separate store/key passwords, so only 3 distinct secret values exist for signing, not 4 — the two password secrets intentionally hold the same value.

Decisions made: see DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-12 block — package name, keystore password-model correction, secret-handling practice going forward, Crashlytics and SMTP deferrals (both intentional, not oversights).

**Next session start point:** Phase 1 is functionally complete except two non-blocking items — placeholder branding assets (app icon, splash screen; no account dependency, can be generated directly) and starting Google Play Console identity verification (long lead time, worth starting early). Otherwise, proceed to Phase 2 — database schema (Postgres tables/migrations in Supabase per ARCHITECTURE.md Section 6).

**2026-09-11 — Seed session**

Built: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/SESSIONS.md` (this file), root `README.md`, `client/README.md` and `server/functions/README.md` placeholders, `privacy-policy.html` placeholder. The target repo (`g-c-3/silver-doodle`) exists and was empty prior to this commit; files were delivered for manual upload rather than pushed directly, since the connected GitHub integration lacked write access to this repository.

Bugs fixed: none (first session).

Decisions made: see `docs/DECISIONS.md`, 2026-09-11 block — covers the full design history preceding this repo's creation (monetization removal, leaderboard scopes, attempt accounting, level/theme shuffle model, ad cadence, auth model, backend/client stack selection, score-integrity model, infra cost planning).

**Next session start point:** Phase 1 of `docs/ROADMAP.md` — infra and secrets setup. This phase is manual/one-time and needs input to proceed: Android keystore generation, Supabase project creation (access token + project ref), Firebase project creation (Analytics + Crashlytics only), and AdMob account/app creation. None of these can be completed without the account holder's direct action.
